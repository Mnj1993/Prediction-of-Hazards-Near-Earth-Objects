#Context:
In the vast expanse of outer space, countless objects orbit around us, some much closer than we realize. While a distance of 70,000 kilometers may seem insignificant, on an astronomical scale, it poses a potential threat, capable of disrupting various natural phenomena. These celestial bodies, including asteroids, have the potential to cause harm. Therefore, understanding our surroundings and identifying potential threats is crucial. This dataset comprises NASA-certified asteroids categorized as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), providing valuable insight into objects that pose the closest proximity to our planet.
